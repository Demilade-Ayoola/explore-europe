          <h1>Camp Nou</h1>
          <p>
            Just as Catalan Modernist buildings are must-see attractions for architecture fans, Camp Nou is a must-see for football (soccer) fans. Camp Nou was one of the venues for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona and today is home of the FC Barcelona team. The 99,354-seat stadium is the largest in Europe and second largest in the world.
</p>
<p>Camp Nou offers guided tours, led by bilingual Official FC Barcelona Guides. The tours (in English and Spanish) cover highlights of the stadium such as the playing field, the team's changing room, players' tunnel, and the commentators' boxes.

          <h1> Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter)</h1>
          <p>
            For 2,000 years, the Gothic Quarter has been the spiritual and secular center of the city. Relics of ancient Roman buildings are still found here, but the Middle Ages are best represented by the historic monuments packed into this quarter.
          </p>
<p>Mainly built between the 13th and 15th centuries, the Catedral de la Santa Cruz y Santa Eulalia is the heart of the Gothic Quarter. Surrounding the cathedral is a maze of cobblestone streets and alleyways.
</p>
<p>Tourists will enjoy wandering the narrow pedestrian lanes, and stopping to discover the neighborhood's quaint boutiques and restaurants. By getting lost here, visitors become immersed in the magical ambience of a traffic-free medieval world.
